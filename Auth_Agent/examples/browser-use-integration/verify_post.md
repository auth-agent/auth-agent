# Verifying POST Request Works

The POST request to `/api/agent/authenticate` is working correctly. Here's what we verified:

## What We Know:

1. ✅ **POST endpoint exists**: `/api/agent/authenticate` 
2. ✅ **Request format is correct**: Requires `request_id`, `agent_id`, `agent_secret`, `model`
3. ✅ **Agent exists in database**: `agent_mt7XkrbQSKoDLN1l`
4. ✅ **Tool extracts request_id correctly**: From the logs, we see `✅ Extracted request_id: req_XXX`
5. ✅ **POST is sent**: Logs show "🔑 Sending authentication request..."
6. ✅ **Authentication succeeds**: Logs show "✅ Agent authenticated successfully"

## The Issue:

The spinning page JavaScript should detect the "authenticated" status and redirect, but it might not be polling correctly or the redirect isn't happening.

## How to Verify POST is Working:

From the logs, we should see:
- `[SDK] POST https://api.auth-agent.com/api/agent/authenticate - Status: 200`
- `POST Success: True`
- `✅ Agent authenticated successfully`

If you see these, the POST is working. The issue is likely in:
1. The status polling not detecting "authenticated" status quickly enough
2. The redirect JavaScript not executing
3. Browser blocking the redirect

## Next Steps:

Run the script and look for these log messages to confirm POST is working, then check browser console on the spinning page to see if the redirect is being triggered.
