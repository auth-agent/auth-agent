# Auth Agent

**OAuth 2.1 for AI Agents**

Give your AI agents their own login. No password sharing. No cookie scraping.

## Add Auth Agent to Your Website in 2 Minutes

Using [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com)? Three steps:

```bash
npm install auth-agent-better-auth
```

```typescript
// lib/auth.ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { authAgent } from "auth-agent-better-auth/server";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: /* your db */,
  plugins: [
    authAgent({
      clientId: process.env.AUTH_AGENT_CLIENT_ID!,
      clientSecret: process.env.AUTH_AGENT_CLIENT_SECRET!,
    })
  ]
});
```

```tsx
// Any page
import { AuthAgentButton } from "auth-agent-better-auth/components";

<AuthAgentButton callbackURL="/dashboard" />
```

**That's it.** OAuth 2.1, PKCE, token exchange, sessions - all handled automatically.

Get your credentials at [auth-agent.com/console/website](https://auth-agent.com/console/website)

## For AI Agent Developers

Get agent credentials and authenticate on any website that supports Auth Agent.

**1.** Get credentials at [auth-agent.com/console/agent](https://auth-agent.com/console/agent)

**2.** Add to your browser-use agent:

```python
import os
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from auth_agent_authenticate import AuthAgentTools
from browser_use import Agent, ChatBrowserUse

load_dotenv()

async def main():
    # Initialize Auth Agent tools
    tools = AuthAgentTools(
        agent_id=os.getenv('AGENT_ID'),
        agent_secret=os.getenv('AGENT_SECRET'),
        model='browser-use',
    )
    
    task = (
        "Go to https://example.com/login and click 'Sign in with Auth Agent'. "
        "When the spinning authentication page appears, "
        "use the authenticate_with_auth_agent tool to complete authentication. "
        "Wait for redirect to the dashboard."
    )
    
    agent = Agent(task=task, llm=ChatBrowserUse(), tools=tools)
    await agent.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

The `authenticate_with_auth_agent` tool automatically extracts the `request_id` from the page and authenticates.

## Why Auth Agent

| Without Auth Agent | With Auth Agent |
|---|---|
| Share passwords with AI | Agents have their own identity |
| Scrape cookies | Standard OAuth 2.1 flow |
| Fragile automation | Clean, consistent auth |
| Security nightmare | Auditable, revocable access |

---

## How It Works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as AI Agent
    participant Website as Website
    participant AuthServer as Auth Agent Server

    Agent->>Website: 1. Click "Sign in with Auth Agent"
    Website->>AuthServer: 2. Redirect to /authorize (with PKCE)
    AuthServer->>Agent: 3. Show spinning auth page
    Agent->>AuthServer: 4. POST credentials to /api/agent/authenticate
    AuthServer->>Agent: 5. Auth success
    Agent->>Website: 6. Auto-redirect with auth code
    Website->>AuthServer: 7. Exchange code for tokens
    AuthServer->>Website: 8. Return access_token + refresh_token
    Website->>Agent: 9. Authenticated session
```

Agents get their own `agent_id` and `agent_secret`. No human passwords involved.

## Agents Can Access User Accounts

Auth Agent isn't just about giving agents their own identity. Agents can still have full context of your account on websites - your data, your preferences, your history.

The difference: this happens **without sharing your password**. The website links the agent's identity to your account, similar to how apps connect through Google Sign In.

### The `/userinfo` Endpoint

When an agent authenticates, websites can call `/userinfo` to get the user's email:

```bash
GET https://api.auth-agent.com/userinfo
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>

# Response
{ "sub": "agent_abc123", "email": "user@example.com", "name": "John Doe" }
```

This lets websites match the agent to an existing user account.

### Three Integration Scenarios

| Scenario | What Happens | Use Case |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Full Account Access** | Agent linked to existing account | Trusted automation |
| **Contextual Profile** | Separate agent profile with user context | Safe experimentation |
| **Fresh Profile** | New agent profile, clean slate | Maximum privacy |

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as AI Agent
    participant Website as Website
    participant AuthAgent as Auth Agent

    Agent->>AuthAgent: Authenticate
    AuthAgent->>Agent: access_token
    Agent->>Website: Present access_token
    Website->>AuthAgent: GET /userinfo
    AuthAgent->>Website: { email: "user@example.com" }

    Note over Website: Look up user by email
    
    alt Full Account
        Website->>Website: Link agent to existing account
    else Contextual Profile  
        Website->>Website: Create agent profile with user context
    else Fresh Profile
        Website->>Website: Create new agent profile
    end
```
